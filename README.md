## Abstract
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, with around 17.9 million deaths annually. This project aims to predict heart failure using data mining techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The research utilizes a comprehensive dataset combining Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Statlog (Heart) datasets. Various algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and ANN, are employed for heart disease prediction. The focus on ANN stems from its efficiency in providing accurate results with minimal execution time.

## Introduction
Heart disease is a critical health issue, with factors like high blood pressure, obesity, and an unhealthy lifestyle contributing to its prevalence. The project addresses the challenge of early detection using data mining techniques, leveraging a dataset curated from multiple sources. The primary objective is to analyze the dataset and predict heart failure, with a special emphasis on the efficacy of ANN.

## Problem Statement
Current hospital management systems face limitations in complex queries for predicting heart disease based on patient medical history. Data mining techniques, particularly ANN, offer potential solutions to improve clinical decisions and prevent heart failure. The project aims to detect heart diseases early, reducing medical errors and improving clinical decisions.

## Objectives
1. Identify predominant symptoms leading to heart diseases in men and women.
2. Reduce the cost of medical tests.
3. Improve clinical decisions for heart failure disease.

## Proposed Work
The project implements five data mining algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks. The dataset is collected from Kaggle, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. Each algorithm's accuracy is evaluated, with a focus on identifying the most suitable model for heart disease prediction.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises 12 attributes and 1190 instances, with no missing values. Key attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, ST slope, and the target variable for heart disease prediction.

## Experimental Work
The project employs various machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks. Results indicate that Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are effective for heart disease detection, achieving high accuracy rates.

## Conclusion
The project successfully explores the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease using data mining techniques, with a focus on ANN. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks demonstrate high accuracy in heart disease prediction. Future enhancements may involve increasing the number of attributes for improved accuracy.
